THIS PROJECT IS NOW DEPRECATED


# Swarmize

Swarmize is a stack of tools to make crowd-powered number-gathering a lot easier.

## The Stack

Swarmize is built out of a number of components, written in either Ruby or Scala, and currently built around an AWS stack including RDS (hosting Postgres), Simple Workflow, DynamoDB, and deployed against Elastic Beanstalk. We use Elasticsearch as a data store.

## Contents

Currently in this repository:

* `api`: The Scala-based API [scala]
* `bombard`: A small script for filling a Swarm with fake data [ruby]
* `case_studies`: the case studies for the project, which are then copied into the Rails app for deployment (but will work fine on Github as they are) [markdown]
* `cloudformation`: AWS CloudFormation config
* `collector`: Receive data from an endpoint and forward it to the stream. [scala]
* `deploy`: The deploy tools/scripts [ruby/bash]
* `examples`: Examples of Collector and Retrieval API usage
* `geocoder`: Simple Node geocoder endpoint [node]
* `livedebate`: Sample app: click on the face you're liking most at any point during a prime ministerial debate; the data - along with some demographic information - will be pushed into Swarm. [ruby]
* `processor`: Processes submitted data [scala]
* `sentiment-endpoint`: Simple Node sentiment analysis endpoint [node]
* `swarmize-dot-com`: the Swarmize alpha website. [ruby]
